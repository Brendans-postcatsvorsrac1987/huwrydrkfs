Just walked out, seriously feeling like I've been spun around in a tumble dryer, you know? Janym Qazaqstan — wow, where to even start? It's all colors and emotions and... I think I stepped on some stale popcorn. Still, it's everywhere really, like the emotional confetti from the movie is scattered on the floor along with it.

The sound in that theater, man, like a constant static in the back, mixing with all the whispers and the lady behind me going at her snack pack. The movie kind of jumps around in that same noisy way, from these sweeping landscapes to these tight, tense close-ups. That moment where the main guy is just staring at the vast nothingness, almost felt like I could see my soul in there, like, deeply mesmerized or maybe just sleep-deprived, who knows.

> I swear, at some point, I was half-expecting a hawk to swoop through the screen, just the way the wind howled on those mountain peaks. There was this thunderous scene — my back still aches from the tension, curled up in the seat like a pretzel, totally absorbed. The storm within the film kind of mirrored the storm of snacks in my lap.

The dialogues come and go like distant thunder, almost an afterthought compared to the visuals — oh, and someone def asked me to download the movie, or was it watch the movie with them? Could be either, my brain's still a bit muddled.

Feels like the movie kept flipping through time, or maybe it's me. Bits and scenes like pages stuck in a gust of wind, endless rotation. There's warmth in it too, like a hug from that elderly man in the film, grounding yet otherworldly. Somehow it all manages to make you feel small and gigantic at the same time. Maybe like if a squirrel wrote a symphony.

Really recommend you — oh wait, was there popcorn in my hair throughout the whole thing? Itchy. Anyway, definitely worth seeing, man. It'll linger, like the stickiness of cola on cinema seats, all unsettling but weirdly comforting in its familiar chaos.
